# RemoveExpPenalty

This [D2RMM](https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/169) mod allows you to remove the experience penalty that starts at level 70.

- Enable/disable the experience penalty
- Adds an experience multiplier from 1x up to 5x
> Note: Multiplier is independent of experience penalty, and will multiply the base values if the penalty isn't disabled
